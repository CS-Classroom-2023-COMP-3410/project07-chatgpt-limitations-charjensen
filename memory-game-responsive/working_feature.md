I took a similar approach to the first project, except it did not go as smoothly this time. I guess that is expected as ChatGPT can't see what is on my screen, but it got it mostly right but I definitely had to do more tinkering afterwards. I got it to make the site responsive, but the fruit was directly placed at the corners of the game container. I wanted it to be offset by a bit so that the fruit was not hiding behind the game. I tried to get chatgpt to do this, but it would fail everytime I asked. Eventually I fixed in myself by figuring out how the fruit is populated around the border, and then changing the offset number until I got the emojis positioned correctly. I have tried numerous configurations of screen sizes and it works really well.
